# HideOthersActivity

HideOthersActivity is a plugin that is designed to hide the
activity status of other users; that is custom activity statuses
and/or game activity statuses. 

This plugin is specifically designed as an accesibility feature, for anyone,
who for any reason, does not want to see the activity of other users.

It does not hide Online/Offline/Idle or Do Not Disturb status icons or
messages, but this may be an optional setting/feature to be added in the
future.
